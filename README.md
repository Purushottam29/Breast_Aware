## Features

- Upload ultrasound images to predict breast cancer.
- Choose from multiple prediction models:
  - DenseNet121 deep learning model.
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
- Fast, secure, and easy-to-use interface.
- Results displayed with clear confidence levels.
- Awareness tips and educational resources.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (initially generated using **Lovable AI**, then customized and integrated by me)
- **Backend**: Python (Streamlit)
- **Models**: DenseNet121, ML models, SVM
- **Deployment**: In progress

## Installation

1 **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Purushottam29/Breast_Aware.git
cd Breast_Aware
```

2 **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3 **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

4 **Run the app**

```bash
python app.py //to run the backend
npm run dev //to start the frontend
```

## Usage

* Open the web app.
* Upload an ultrasound image.
* Select the prediction model (DenseNet121 or SVM).
* Click **Predict**.
* View results and suggestions.

---

## Future Improvements

- Improve model accuracy with larger datasets.
- Deploy to a production-grade backend.
